# live-clock-date-toggle

Author : RAJIV KUMAR GOND

This is a basic project I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It shows the current time, and when I click on it, the full date appears. Clicking again hides it.

## Features

- Live time update
- Toggle full date on click
- Gradient background for styling

## Files

- assets/icon.png
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

Open index.html in a browser to try it out.
